# Create a Realm Project with Ease!

Just make sure you have 
1. Node v6.10.3 or higher
2. XCode 8.3.2 or higher installed
3. `npm install -g realm-cli`

## Creating a new Realm Project!

`realm-cli init myapp`
This will create, ROS, iOS, and Android Projects
```shell
/myapp
    /server
    /ios
    /android
```

## Contributor Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/realm/realm-cli.git`
2. `cd realm-cli && npm install`
3. `npm run build`
4. Go to your `~/.bash_profile`
5. add an alias
     a. if you like `realm` as a command then put `alias realm="node ~/realm-cli/dist/index.js"` (or the location of index.ts of this project)
     b. if you like to use `realm-cli` as the command `alias realm-cli="node ~/realm-cli/dist/index.js"` (or the location of index.ts of this project)

All we did was install dependencies and link an `alias` to our command program
